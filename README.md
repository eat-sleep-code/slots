# Slots

This is a work-in-progress Python slot machine game.   The basic mechanics are working.


## TODO:

- Design reel graphics to replace free placeholders
- Design pay line graphic
- Write logic to only pay out on the payline
- Decide actual triggering mechanism -- button?
- Add audio
- Can this run on MicroPython (Pico W) or does it require Python (Pi Zero)
- Build machine
